                                  Yong-jin Choiâ€™s six year old daughter, Jun-won, has gone missing fourteen years ago. On 2000 April 4, Jun-won told her father that she was going to the playground and disappeared. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p class="excerpt">
                                  He has been obsessively searching for Jun-won for years but all in vain. The longer he tries to find her, the faster the world forgets her disappearance. It did not take a very long time for him to realize that there is no one but himself to rely on and he started his own investigation. 
                                  </p>
                                  <p class="excerpt">
                                  All of a sudden, he became a complete stranger in the place he had always felt familiar with. Fourteen years have passed since the day of missing and living with a missing child has become his everyday life. Will he find his daughter back? Or will he be able to get closer to his daughter?
